# FightProgram

## introduction
This is a small project written quite a while ago, while studying the language. Exploratively and ludically.
It is a small project that names and creates many classes that could be sensible to have in a game, and implements only a few of them. There is a file with a main function (That would be program.cs), making use of some of them to make two contenders fight, making use of stats and luck variables. Feel free to read, and play with it if you like it
